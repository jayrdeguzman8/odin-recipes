    <p>Tapsilog is one of my favorite breakfast meal options during big days. These are days wherein I need to complete several tasks. Having this meal gives me the needed energy to perform work and it keeps me full longer. I also enjoy starting my day with a delicious breakfast.</p>
    <p>The word Tapsilog is an acronym that stands for Tapa Sinangag at Itlog. These are the three components of the meal. Tapa refers to beef tapa. This are fried marinated beef slices.</p>
